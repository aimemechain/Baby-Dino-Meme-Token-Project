Key Governance Features:
1.	DAO Model: BABYD token holders will have voting rights through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Proposals on key issues, tokenomics adjustments, and future developments will be voted upon by the community.
2.	Community Proposals: Token holders will be able to submit proposals for new features, partnerships, or promotional events. Community votes will determine the direction of the project.
3.	Voting Process: BABYD token holders will have voting power proportional to the number of tokens they own. Higher holdings equate to more influence in decision-making processes.

Security and Transparency
Security and transparency are core principles of the Baby Dino Meme Token. We are dedicated to ensuring that all BABYD transactions are secure, verifiable, and free from vulnerabilities.

Security Features:
1.	Smart Contract Audits: The BABYD smart contract will undergo audits to ensure its safety, security, and absence of malicious code. Audit reports will be made publicly available for transparency.
2.	Anti-Whale Mechanism: To prevent price manipulation, we have implemented anti-whale features such as transaction limits and taxes on large transfers. This ensures a fair token distribution.
3.	Token Burn Mechanism: A percentage of tokens will be burned periodically to reduce overall supply, helping to increase scarcity and long-term value.
Transparency Features:
•	Audit Reports: Regular audit reports and project updates will be published to maintain trust and transparency with the community.
•	Blockchain Data: All transactions will be recorded on the Binance Smart Chain, providing full transparency and verifiability.
